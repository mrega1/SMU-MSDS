This assignment starts with a list of baby names and how many children where named those in 2015 and 2016. 
This R markdown file cleans up each data set and merges them. 
It then sums the total children named that specific name in 2015 and 2016 then finds the ten most popular names. 
After this it omits the boy names and writes a csv file of the top ten most used girl names.



CodeBook:
df=baby names from 2016, their gender, and how many times that name was used
y2016=df but with mispelt name removed
y2015=baby names from 2015, their gender, and how many times that name was used
final=a table with a first name, gender, and how many children were named that in 2015 and 2016.
      column is later added that shows how many babies where named that combined in both years
girl=ten most popular girl names over the span of 2015-2016
Baby_Names=csv file of girl
